                  Rajendra Kumhar ji is the son of the padmashree award winner
                  Mohanlal Chaturbhuj Kumhar. He has been practicing the art of
                  molela terracotta for 18 years now! Being an artisan came
                  naturally to him. While he attended school and got proper
                  academic education, he spent a large chunk of his childhood
                  watching his father work and eventually adopted the craft and
                  decided to take it forward.

            <h3>lifestyle</h3>
            <p>
              Rajendra Ji comes off as a very down-to-earth person who takes
              great work in his pride. Even when he spoke to us we could see him
              fiddling with a semi-dry pot. To the untrained eye, the pot looked
              finished and perfected! But he continued to run a soft white stone
              pebble over it to polish the surface. ​<br /><br />

              When asked about his daily routine, he replied very nonchalantly
              that work happens when there is motivation, inspiration, and
              requirement. There is no morning prayer before starting work. At a
              stretch, he might sit crouched in front of his piece with his
              tools and work for long hours. But when inspiration is scarce, he
              prefers to take walks around his house and on the village streets
              to clear his head. ​<br /><br />

              Rajendra Ji used to play around his father’s workshop quite often
              as a child. Sitting on the wheel or just imitating his father with
              clay. A big part of his childhood was spent in his father's
              studio, he says and we quote, “I don’t even know when all these
              fun and games became my profession. It was all so natural!”
