        <h2>THE STORY OF MOLELA</h2>
        <div class="divider" style="width: 150px; height: 2px"></div>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em">
          Molela’s peasant potters have passed down their craftsmanship over to
          the next generation for decades now. It is believed that the craft has
          been alive for more than 5000 years now and is known to be the only
          pottery craft in the country to create beautiful semi 3D narratives on
          a tile. The origin of the clay craft of molela terracotta itself is
          steeped in myth and divinity as the Kumar’s of this village believe
          that their clay craft is ‘’God-given’’. To substantiate that claim a
          story very often narrated by many of them is that of a blind potter of
          the bygone age. <br /><br />
          The story goes like such; One-day Dharmraj or Devnarayan (Vishnu)
          appeared in a blind potter’s dream. Being summoned by the gods
          himself, the potter was asked to make a vaahan for Dev Narayan Ji. The
          next morning the potter immediately got to work. He went to the
          riverside of Banas and collected the clay he needed. He fulfilled the
          task assigned to him. Pleased by the outcome and the potter’s devotion
          to his skill, Dharmraj restored his eyesight. from that day the clay
          craft stayed in the family of the potter and art travelled through
          generations. Thus Dharamraja on horse is dominant motif in terracottas
          of Molela.

            <h3>DHARMARAJ- The KING OF JUSTICE</h3>
            <p>
              Yama is the Hindu god of death, king of ancestors, and final judge
              on the destination of souls. He is also known as the ‘Restrainer’,
              Pretaraja or ‘King of Ghosts’. He is also given the title of
              Dharmaraja or ‘King of Justice’. ​<br /><br />

              Dharmaraj has been linked with many gods such as Shiva, Vishnu,
              Sun-god Surya, Varuna, Yama, and even with Buddhism. ​<br /><br />

              The main gods were Devanarayan on a horse holding a spear and a
              lotus. Other gods are accomplices of Devnarayan like Yamaraj, the
              god of the dead, Bhairon in two forms— dark and ferocious, fair
              and compassionate, Ganesh, Durga, Sheshavatar, the serpent god
              Nagdev, etc

            <h3>DEVI PLAQUES</h3>
            <p>
              In Rajasthan terracotta images of the mother, goddess showed in
              various incarnations are broadly worshipped by the tribals. Molela
              lies in the Mewar region of Rajasthan where great reverence is
              given to the mother goddess or ‘Mata’. The Devi is the symbol of
              valour and is worshipped with great devotion and zeal. As Devi is
              manifested into many different forms, her image has been a popular
              subject to the craftsmen of Molela Terracotta.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="para">
            <p>
              Devis are often depicted on their respected vaahans and are
              creations of lovely craftsmanship. The most sought-after Mata
              plaques by the tribal clients are Chamunda on the elephant, Kalika
              astride buffalo, Durga with the lion, etc. <br /><br />
              It is interesting to note that the mother goddess is a revered
              feature of many civilizations and cultures. She appears invarious
              forms to different eyes but she is a figure of great power and is
              worshipped to averrt any misfortunes in the respective beliefs.

            <h3>PABUJI KI KAHANI</h3>
            <p>
              Pabuji is a known folk hero in the Rajasthani culture and is
              subject to not only many Molela plaques but also many phad
              paintings. The narrative of Pabuji is sung by the Bhopa
              poet-singers of the Nayak community is based according to the
              tradition on a text, the Pabuprakasa. <br /><br />​ Pabuji was one
              of Dhadal Rathore’s four children in the village of Kolu. However,
              unlike his siblings, Pabuji was born of a celestial nymph and was
              known to be god’s incarnate. He was twelve years old when the
              nymph said that she would return to him in the form of a mare for
              him to ride.

              He had four companions: Chando and Dhebo, two brothers of whom
              Dhebo was a colossus with an insatiable appetite for food, drink
              and opium, and immensely aggressive. One of his popular exploit
              detail how he overthrew Mirza Khan the cow killing patan. After
              his conquest he then went to bathe in the holy lake of Pushkar to
              cleanse himself of the sin of bloodshed. Whilst he was bathing his
              foot slipped, and he was saved from drowning by the snake-god Gogo
              Chauhan.
